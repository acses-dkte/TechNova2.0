# TechNova 2.0 - TechSymposium 🚀

Welcome to **TechNova 2.0**, a technical event conducted as part of the grand **TechSymposium** at **DKTE**. This repository contains questions of all the rounds conducted during the event.

## Event Structure 📚

TechNova 2.0 consisted of three challenging rounds, designed to assess participants' proficiency in **programming fundamentals, debugging skills, and problem-solving abilities**.

### 1. Technical Quiz 📝

In the first round, participants faced a **multiple-choice question (MCQ) quiz** focused on **fundamentals of programming** and an **in-depth knowledge test** across various technical domains.

### 2. Debugging C Programs 🐞

The second round involved **identifying and correcting errors** in given **C programs**. Participants had to debug the code and produce the correct output.

### 3. HackerRank Contest 💻

The final round was a **competitive coding contest on HackerRank**, where participants solved programming challenges under time constraints, similar to real-world coding competitions.
